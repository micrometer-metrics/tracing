== Configuring with Micrometer Observation

=== Handler Configuration

// TODO: We need to separately document that Micrometer provides a TimerObservationHandler

For Micrometer Tracing to work with Micrometer Observation, you need to add a tracing-related `ObservationHandler`.
The following example shows how to add and use a single `DefaultTracingObservationHandler`:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingConfiguringTests.java[tags=handler_configuration,indent=0]
-----

You can also use a shorter version to perform measurements by using the `observe` method:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingConfiguringTests.java[tags=handler_configuration_observe,indent=0]
-----

This will result in the following Micrometer Metrics:

```
Gathered the following metrics
    Meter with name <my.operation> and type <TIMER> has the following measurements
        <[
            Measurement{statistic='COUNT', value=1.0},
            Measurement{statistic='TOTAL_TIME', value=1.011949454},
            Measurement{statistic='MAX', value=1.011949454}
        ]>
        and has the following tags <[tag(this.tag=will end up as a meter tag and a span tag)]>
```

It also results in the following trace view in (for example) Zipkin:

==== Ordered Handler Configuration

Micrometer Tracing comes with multiple `ObservationHandler` implementations.
To introduce ordering, you can use the `ObservationHandler.AllMatchingCompositeObservationHandler` to run logic for all `ObservationHandler` instances that match the given predicate and `ObservationHandler`. Use `FirstMatchingCompositeObservationHandler` to run logic only for the first `ObservationHandler` that matches the predicate.
The former can group handlers and the latter can be chosen to (for example) run only one matching `TracingObservationHandler`.

=== Context Propagation with Micrometer Tracing

To make https://micrometer.io/docs/contextPropagation[Context Propagation] work with Micrometer Tracing, you need to manually register the proper `ThreadLocalAccessor`, as follows:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingConfiguringTests.java[tags=thread_local_accessors,indent=0]
-----

The `ObservationAwareSpanThreadLocalAccessor` is required to propagate manually created spans (not the ones that are governed by Observations). The `ObservationAwareBaggageThreadLocalAccessor` is required to propagate baggage created by the user.

With Project Reactor one should set the values of `Observation`, `Span` or `BaggageToPropagate` in the Reactor Context as follows:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]

// Setup example
include::{include-integration-tests}/src/test/java/io/micrometer/tracing/test/contextpropagation/AbstractObservationAwareSpanThreadLocalAccessorTests.java[tags=setup,indent=0]

include::{include-integration-tests}/src/test/java/io/micrometer/tracing/test/contextpropagation/AbstractObservationAwareSpanThreadLocalAccessorTests.java[tags=setup_accessors,indent=0]

// Usage example
include::{include-integration-tests}/src/test/java/io/micrometer/tracing/test/contextpropagation/AbstractObservationAwareSpanThreadLocalAccessorTests.java[tags=docs,indent=0]

=== Exemplars

To add support for https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/fundamentals/exemplars/[exemplars] instead of using the `DefaultMeterObservationHandler` you should use the `TracingAwareMeterObservationHandler`, as follows:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
