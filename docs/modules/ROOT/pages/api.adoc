= Using Micrometer Tracing Directly

In this section, we describe how to use the Micrometer Tracing API to directly create and report spans.

== Micrometer Tracing Examples

The following example shows the basic operations on a span. Read the comments in the snippet for details:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]

include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingApiTests.java[tags=manual_span_creation,indent=0]
-----

The following example shows how to continue a span in a new thread that was started in another thread:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingApiTests.java[tags=manual_span_continuation,indent=0]
-----

The following example shows how to create a child span when explicitly knowing who the parent span is:

-----

== Micrometer Tracing Brave Setup

In this subsection, we set up Micrometer Tracing with Brave.

The following example shows how to create a Micrometer Tracing `Tracer` by using Brave components that would send completed spans to Zipkin:

-----

== Micrometer Tracing OpenTelemetry Setup

In this subsection, we set up Micrometer Tracing with OpenTelemetry (OTel).

The following example shows how to create a Micrometer Tracing `Tracer` by using OTel components that would send completed spans to Zipkin:

== Micrometer Tracing Baggage API

Traces connect from application to application by using header propagation. Besides trace identifiers, other properties (called `Baggage`) can also be passed along with the request.

The following example shows how to use the Tracer API to create and extract baggage:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]

include::{include-bridges-java}/micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave/src/test/java/io/micrometer/tracing/brave/bridge/BraveTracingApiTests.java[tags=baggage_api,indent=0]
-----

IMPORTANT: For Brave, remember to set up the `PropagationFactory` so that it contains the baggage fields that you will be using in your code. Check the following example for details:

include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingApiTests.java[tags=baggage_brave_setup,indent=0]

=== Baggage with Micrometer Observation API

If you're using Micrometer Observation API, there's no notion of baggage. If you set up a `BaggageManager` to have the baggage fields configured, we will assume that when the Observation gets put in scope, whatever low and high cardinality keys are set on the Observation will be put in scope as baggage (assuming that their names match with the configuration on the `BaggageManager`). Below you can find example of such setup with OpenTelemetry `BaggageManager`.

== Aspect Oriented Programming

Micrometer Tracing contains `@NewSpan`, `@ContinueSpan`, and `@SpanTag` annotations that frameworks can use to create or customize spans for either specific types of methods such as those serving web request endpoints or, more generally, to all methods.

WARNING: Micrometer's Spring Boot configuration does _not_ recognize these aspects on arbitrary methods.

An AspectJ aspect is included. You can use it in your application, either through compile/load time AspectJ weaving or through framework facilities that interpret AspectJ aspects and proxy targeted methods in some other way, such as Spring AOP. Here is a sample Spring AOP configuration:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]

include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingSpanAspectTests.java[tags=spring_config,indent=0]
-----

Applying `SpanAspect` makes `@NewSpan` and `@ContinueSpan` usable on any arbitrary method in an AspectJ proxied instance, as the following example shows:
