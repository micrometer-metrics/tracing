= Testing

Micrometer Tracing includes the `micrometer-tracing-test` and `micrometer-tracing-integration-test` modules.

For unit tests, it provides a `SimpleTracer` that is a test implementation of a `Tracer`.

For integration tests, it provides a `SampleTestRunner` mechanism that you can hook into your samples.
It:

* Configures an OpenZipkin Brave Tracer
** Sets it up with Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Reporter
** Sets it up with OpenZipkin Zipkin Reporter
* Configures an OpenTelemetry Tracer
** Sets it up with Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Exporter
** Sets it up with OpenZipkin Zipkin Exporter
* Runs all the combinations above against the user code and running infrastructure

CAUTION: The Wavefront Reporter and its test support have been deprecated because https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/release-announcements/0/25153[Wavefront's End of Life Announcement].

== Installing

The following example shows the required dependency in Gradle (assuming that Micrometer Tracing BOM has been added):

[source,groovy,subs=+attributes]
-----
testImplementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-test' // for unit tests
testImplementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-integration-test' // for integration tests
-----

The following example shows the required dependency in Maven (assuming that Micrometer Tracing BOM has been added):

[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
-----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-test</artifactId> <!-- For unit tests -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-integration-test</artifactId> <!-- For integration tests -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

== Running Tracing Unit Tests

To run unit tests of your custom handler, you may want to use the `SimpleTracer` test `Tracer` implementation. Let's assume the following custom `TracingObservationHandler`:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingTestingTests.java[tags=observation_handler,indent=0]
-----

To verify whether the spans got properly created we can use the `SimpleTracer`, as follows:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingTestingTests.java[tags=handler_test,indent=0]
-----

== Running integration tests

The following example shows how you can run your code to test your integrations:

* By asserting spans that were stored without emitting them to a reporting system
* Against running Tanzu Observability by Wavefront instance (this option turns on when you have passed the Wavefront related configuration in the constructor - otherwise the test will be disabled)
* Against running Zipkin instance (this option turns on when Zipkin is running - otherwise the test will be disabled)

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingTestingTests.java[tags=observability_smoke_test,indent=0]
