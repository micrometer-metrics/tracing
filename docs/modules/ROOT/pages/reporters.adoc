= Supported Reporters

Micrometer Tracing supports directly the following Reporters.

* https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability[*Tanzu Observability by Wavefront*]
* https://zipkin.io[*OpenZipkin Zipkin*]

CAUTION: The Wavefront Reporter has been deprecated because https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/release-announcements/0/25153[Wavefront's End of Life Announcement].

== Installing

The following example shows the required dependency in Gradle (assuming that Micrometer Tracing BOM has been added):

.Tanzu Observability by Wavefront
[source,groovy,subs=+attributes]
----
implementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-reporter-wavefront'
----

.OpenZipkin Zipkin with Brave
[source,groovy,subs=+attributes]
----
implementation 'io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave'
----

.OpenZipkin Zipkin with OpenTelemetry
[source,groovy,subs=+attributes]
----
implementation 'io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin'
----

.An OpenZipkin URL sender dependency to send out spans to Zipkin via a `URLConnectionSender`
[source,groovy,subs=+attributes]
----
implementation 'io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-urlconnection'
----

The following example shows the required dependency in Maven (assuming that Micrometer Tracing BOM has been added):

.Tanzu Observability by Wavefront
[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-reporter-wavefront</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.OpenZipkin Zipkin with Brave
[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.zipkin.reporter2</groupId>
    <artifactId>zipkin-reporter-brave</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.OpenZipkin Zipkin with OpenTelemetry
[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.An OpenZipkin URL sender dependency to send out spans to Zipkin via a `URLConnectionSender`
[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.zipkin.reporter2</groupId>
    <artifactId>zipkin-sender-urlconnection</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

IMPORTANT: Remember that, by default, Brave adds Zipkin as a dependency. If you want to use only Wavefront and you use classpath dependent solutions, such as Spring Boot, you might be required to exclude the transitive dependency on Zipkin when using Brave (for example, by excluding the `io.zipkin.reporter2` group).
