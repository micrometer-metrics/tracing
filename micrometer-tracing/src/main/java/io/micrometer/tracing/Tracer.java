/**
 * This API was heavily influenced by Brave. Parts of its documentation were taken
 * directly from Brave.
 *
 * Using a tracer, you can create a root span capturing the critical path of a request.
 * Child spans can be created to allocate latency relating to outgoing requests.
 *
 * When tracing single-threaded code, just run it inside a scoped span: <pre>{@code
 * // Start a new trace or a span within an existing trace representing an operation
 * ScopedSpan span = tracer.startScopedSpan("encode");
 * try {
 *   // The span is in "scope" so that downstream code such as loggers can see trace IDs
 *   return encoder.encode();
 * } catch (RuntimeException | Error e) {
 *   span.error(e); // Unless you handle exceptions, you might not know the operation failed!
 *   throw e;
 * } finally {
 *   span.end();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * When you need more features, or finer control, use the {@linkplain Span} type:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Start a new trace or a span within an existing trace representing an operation
 * Span span = tracer.nextSpan().name("encode").start();
 * // Put the span in "scope" so that downstream code such as loggers can see trace IDs
 * try (SpanInScope ws = tracer.withSpanInScope(span)) {
 *   return encoder.encode();
 * } catch (RuntimeException | Error e) {
 *   span.error(e); // Unless you handle exceptions, you might not know the operation failed!
 *   throw e;
 * } finally {
 *   span.end(); // note the scope is independent of the span. Always finish a span.
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Both of the above examples report the exact same span on finish!
